<h1>
Who can give blood?
</h1>
<p >
    Everyone can volunteer to give blood, whether they have a disability or not.However, we must make sure that it’s safe for people to give blood and for patients to receive donated blood.

We need to be certain that anyone who wants to give blood understand what’s involved, how they will feel, and the things they’ll need to do afterwards to take care of themselves.
 If we think that someone doesn’t completely understand, we can’t let them give blood.


The donor must be fit and healthy, and should not be suffering from transmittable diseases.You must be in good health at the time you donate.
 You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.
    
    If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.
     If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, 
        you can donate blood after 12 hours.
    
 If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month
    
   You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation.</p>
