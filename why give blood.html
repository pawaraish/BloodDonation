            <h2><b>Why give blood?</b></h2>
                <p> Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments.
                  We need new blood donors from all backgrounds to ensure there is the right blood available for patients who need it.</p>
                <p>Nearly 400 new donors a day to meet demand.
Around 135,000 new donors a year to replace those who can no longer donate
40,000 more black donors to meet growing demand for better-matched blood
30,000 new donors with priority blood types such as O negative every year.
More young people to start giving blood so we can make sure we have enough blood in the future</p>

 <p>Safe blood saves lives.
  Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients.

    There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use.<br><br> Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
    
  Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.
Your health and well-being are very important to the blood service.The needle and blood bag used to collect blood come in a sterile pack that cannot be reused, so the process is made as safe as possible</p>
